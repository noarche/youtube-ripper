# ꧁꧂  Youtube-Ripper

Youtube Ripper lets you easily save youtube videos as video or audio using the highest quality by available. 




# ꧁꧂  How to run

Download youtube-ripper.exe and run it as you would a normal portable app. It will create the download directories in the same folder the exe is located.

If you prefer to use the python script follow the steps below:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🛡️ Is this a virus❔

No it is not a virus, that is a false positive. Anything compiled with pyinstaller will be flagged as potentially malicious. Pyinstaller is what turns the .py file into a .exe file and allows people to run python scripts as portable applications without the need to install python or any dependancies.  

Please scan the actual source, the file that ends with '.py' -  It will with no doubt be 100% clean on virustotal.  That being said I have provided instructions on how to build your own exe from the file you know is clean.

🛡️ Tip for all questionable applications: 

*Running the application via [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/) or similar app will virutalize and protect your OS as if it was running on a virtual machine - [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/) can be used with any application or installation package thus another great tool to have.*
